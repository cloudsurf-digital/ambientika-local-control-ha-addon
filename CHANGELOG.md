### Version 1.0.23 - Database Constraints Fix

#### Fixed
- SQLITE_CONSTRAINT errors for undefined device roles
- Database constraint handling for device role field

### Version 1.0.22 - Changelog Format

#### Fixed
- **Changelog Format**: Removed incorrect dates from changelog entries
- Simplified format for better readability and accuracy

### Version 1.0.21 - Changelog Visibility

#### Fixed
- **Changelog Visibility**: Added CHANGELOG.md to add-on directory for Home Assistant UI
- Ensures changelog is properly displayed in Home Assistant add-on store

### Version 1.0.20 - Preset Mode Sensor

#### Added
- **New Sensor**: Dedicated preset mode sensor for Home Assistant
  - Creates separate `sensor.<device_serial>_preset_mode` entity for each device
  - Shows current operating mode (SMART, INTAKE, AUTO, AWAY_HOME, etc.)
  - Uses `mdi:tune-variant` icon for clear visual identification
  - Automatically discovered when devices connect

#### Changed
- Enhanced Home Assistant integration with additional sensor entities
- Improved device visibility for dashboards and automations

### Version 1.0.19 - Critical Connection Routing Fix

#### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed socket connection routing bug causing devices to become permanently unresponsive
  - Commands now route to correct device based on serial number mapping instead of IP address only
  - Prevents MASTER socket from being overwritten when SLAVE device connects from same IP
  - Resolves issue where devices would stop responding after SLAVE connection
- **UI**: Removed invalid "auto" fan speed option from Home Assistant interface
  - Added validation to only accept LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH fan speeds
  - Fixed AUTO->MEDIUM mapping that was creating confusion
  - Added explicit `fan_modes` configuration to prevent non-existent options

#### Changed
- Improved command routing with IP:port connection keys instead of IP-only mapping
- Enhanced error handling for invalid fan speed commands
- Better device connection logging with connection key details

### Version 1.0.18 - Build Error Fix

#### Fixed
- Fixed TypeScript build errors by reverting `trace` back to `silly` log level
- Winston Logger compatibility: Updated config schema to match Winston levels (silly|debug|info|warn|error)

#### Added
- Deep command analysis for debugging command rejections
- Enhanced UDP broadcast logging with device roles and coordination details
- Improved command transmission debugging with hex buffer output

#### Changed
- Command timeout reduced to 5 seconds for faster failure detection
- Removed rate limiting as real issue was socket routing bug

#### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Removed fake UI state overrides that masked real device command failures
- Fixed command persistence logic to show actual device state instead of assumed success
- Enhanced logging to detect when devices reject operating mode commands

#### Added
- Comprehensive buffer analysis showing byte-by-byte breakdown for debugging
- Device role information included in status logging
- UDP coordination patterns visible at silly log level

### Version 1.0.16 - Architecture Badges

#### Fixed
- Log level configuration not being passed from Home Assistant add-on settings
- Various logging improvements for better debugging visibility

### Future Releases

#### Planned
